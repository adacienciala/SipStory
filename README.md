## Project Description

Matcha enthusiasts investing in premium products often lack a structured, dedicated tool to record nuanced tasting details (umami depth, foam quality, sweetness vs bitterness). General note or tea apps miss matcha-specific attributes, making it hard to remember which expensive blends are worth reordering. SipStory solves this by providing an authenticated, private web application where users:

- Log detailed tasting notes with both required and optional structured fields.
- Maintain consistency via autocomplete suggestion of previously used Brands, Blends, and Regions.
- Filter and sort entries to rapidly locate high-quality tastings.
- Compare any two tastings side-by-side for direct evaluation.

Runtime Node version: see `.nvmrc`.

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (use `nvm` for version management)
- npm (bundled with Node) or alternative (pnpm/yarn) if preferred
- A Supabase project (for Auth & DB)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd SipStory
```

### 2. Use the correct Node version

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create `src/env.d.ts` entries (already scaffolded) and a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Reference via `import.meta.env.PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` inside Astro/React components or server endpoints.

### 5. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the app at the printed local URL (default: `http://localhost:3000`).

### 6. Lint & Format (optional during development)

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### 7. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### 8. Deployments & Releases

The project is configured for continuous deployment to **Cloudflare Pages**. Every push to the `main` branch triggers a new build and deployment via GitHub Actions.

### 9. Shadcn/ui Components

Components will reside under `src/components/ui`. Generate new components using the project’s helper scripts (to be added). Follow accessibility guidelines (ARIA attributes, focus management).

### 10. Tailwind CSS

Global styles: `src/styles/global.css`. Use arbitrary values for one-offs and responsive variants (`sm: md: lg:`). Prefer semantic component abstractions + variant utilities.
